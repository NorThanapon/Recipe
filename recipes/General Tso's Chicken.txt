Ingredients

750 g Chicken dark meat (thighs or legs). Boneless, skinless, uncooked. Cut into a 2 cm cubes.
1 egg
1 tbsp. light soy sauce
2-3 tbsp. cornstarch, or as needed to thicken batter
Seasoning to taste
700 ml oil to deep fry, or enough oil to shallow-fry
2 tbsp. dark soy sauce
1 tbsp. rice vinegar
1 tbsp. Shaoxing rice wine
1 tbsp. granulated sugar
3 tbsp. chicken stock (optionally, water will suffice)
1 tbsp. finely chopped ginger
1 tbsp. crushed and chopped garlic
1 tbsp. cornstarch (optionally, to thicken sauce)
4 spring onions, sliced
1 tbsp. chopped dried chilli peppers

Beat the egg and light soy sauce together with the seasoning in a bowl
Mix the chicken with the egg mixture and stir in the cornstarch to thicken the batter
Mix sauce ingredients in another bowl and set aside until needed. Stir out any lumps.
Heat the oil in a wok (if deep frying, this is about 180 Celsius)
If deep frying, fry the pieces of battered chicken a few at a time until crispy (around 3 minutes). If shallow-frying, fry until the chicken is cooked and the batter is golden.
Empty and wipe clean the wok, add 2 tbsp. oil for shallow-frying and return to the heat. Remove excess oil from the chicken pieces if deep-frying.
Fry the spring onions and chilli together from about 30 seconds.
Add the chicken cubes back to the wok and stir fry in the vegetables until browning.
Stir sauce and add to wok. After the sauce comes to a boil, cook for about 1 minute (until sauce thickens - the exact time will depend partly on how much cornstarch you added).
Remove from heat and serve immediately.
